## Installation
There are no installation instructions at this time, visiting the URL provided in the repository is all that is needed as this is a front-end application.

## Usage
In order to use this application you must click the play button to start the timer, once you have the time reached you can pause it and choose to either archive or simply delete it. Once you feel the need to get rid of your archived times, simply press the clear button and it will delete all the times.

## To-dos
The application still needs work on the logic side of things. This is a demo and has not been tested by anyone by myself. Once the timer hits over a minute archiving only covers the seconds and miliseconds, this makes it pointless once you hit the minutes which might occur more often than not. This application also needs to be mobile responsive.
